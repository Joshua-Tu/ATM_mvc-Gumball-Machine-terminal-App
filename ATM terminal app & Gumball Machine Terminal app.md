# ATM terminal app & Gumball Machine Terminal app

## The ATM terminal app is my first MVC terminal app, I did this for practice.

* To run this app, in the CLI terminal, type the following content. The ATM_mvc_model.rb and ATM_mvc_view.rb must be in the same directory as ATM_mvc_controller.rb.

  ``` $ Ruby ATM_mvc_controller.rb ```

* Gumball Machine Terminal app is just for practice, I just filled in some lines of it to make it work. I didn't write the whole program.
